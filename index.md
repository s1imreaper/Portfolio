Hi! My name is Tejas and I'm a junior at NYU majoring in Data Science with a minor in Math and CS. I'm fascinated by the power of data and its potential to drive innovation across all disciplines. However, the two particular domains that I am currently most interested are sports and medicine.

I believe that data science in sports can help teams make better decisions, improve player performance, and ultimately increase their chances of success. 
Likewise, with the abundance of data in healthcare, there is a tremendous opportunity to use data science to identify patterns, predict outcomes, and improve patient care. My aim is to use data science and mathematics for insight. 

This is just an archive of my data science and machine learning projects.
